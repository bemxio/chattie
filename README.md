# Chattie, a chatroom with HTML tag abilities!
Made for fun and for finally completing my idea of making a chatroom, as well as for learning more stuff about websockets! :^)

## Running

### Client
It's recommended to use the [official link](https://bemxio.xyz/chattie) to connect to a server.

You can simply double-click the HTML file or run it with any kind of a web server if you really want to, it should work fine.

### Server
Make sure you are running Python 3.8 or higher. You will need that thingy if you want to run a server.

1. Clone the repository to a directory of your choice.
2. Install the requirements using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Done! Run the server using `python3 -m server <host> <port>`.
